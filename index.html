      <header>Porting Python 2 Code to Python 3</header>
      <p>With Python 3 being the future of Python while Python 2 is still in active use, it is good to have your project
        available for both major releases of Python. This guide is meant to help you figure out how best to support both
        Python 2 & 3 simultaneously.</p>
      <p>If you are looking to port an extension module instead of pure Python code, please see Porting Extension
        Modules to Python 3.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Only worry about supporting Python 2.7</li>
          <li>Make sure you have good test coverage (coverage.py can help; python -m pip install coverage)</li>
          <li>Learn the differences between Python 2 & 3</li>
          <li>Use Futurize (or Modernize) to update your code (e.g. python -m pip install future)</li>
          <li>Use Pylint to help make sure you don’t regress on your Python 3 support (python -m pip install pylint)</li>
        </ul>

      <code>
          [x, y for x in seq1 for y in seq2]
# Correct
[(x, y) for x in seq1 for y in seq2]

      <header>Porting Extension Modules to Python 3</header>
      <p>We recommend the following resources for porting extension modules to Python 3:</p>
      <p>The Migrating C extensions chapter from Supporting Python 3: An in-depth guide, a book on moving from Python 2
        to Python 3 in general, guides the reader through porting an extension module.</p>
      <code>
      for expr1 in sequence1:
    if not (condition1):
        continue   # Skip this element
    for expr2 in sequence2:
        if not (condition2):
            continue   # Skip this element
        ...
        for exprN in sequenceN:
            if not (conditionN):

      <header>Curses Programming with Python</header>
      <p>The curses library supplies a terminal-independent screen-painting and keyboard-handling facility for
        text-based terminals; such terminals include VT100s, the Linux console, and the simulated terminal provided by
        various programs. Display terminals support various control codes to perform common operations such as moving
        the cursor, scrolling the screen, and erasing areas. Different terminals use widely differing codes, and often
        have their own minor quirks.</p>
      <p>In a world of graphical displays, one might ask “why bother”? It’s true that character-cell display terminals
        are an obsolete technology, but there are niches in which being able to do fancy things with them are still
        valuable. One niche is on small-footprint or embedded Unixes that don’t run an X server. Another is tools such
        as OS installers and kernel configurators that may have to run before any graphical support is available.

      <p>
        The “primer” gives a basic overview, moving gently from simple examples, adding one feature at a time. Start
        here if you’re new to descriptors.
      </p>
      <p>
        The second section shows a complete, practical descriptor example. If you already know the basics, start there.

        for i in obj:
    print(i)

      <p>
        In this document, we’ll take a tour of Python’s features suitable for implementing programs in a functional
        style. After an introduction to the concepts of functional programming, we’ll look at language features such as
        iterators and generators and relevant library modules such as itertools and functools.
      </p>
      <p>
        This section explains the basic concept of functional programming; if you’re just interested in learning about
        Python language features, skip to the next section on Iterators.

        Programming languages support decomposing problems in several different ways:

      <code>
        for i in iter(obj):
    print(i)
